#
# Notes:
#
# - Command-line arguments specified in either configuration files
#   must be separated by a newline character. For example, to specify
#   "--global-log /tmp/foo.txt", you need to specify this as two lines
#   in the configuration file:
#
#     --global-log
#     /tmp/foo.txt
#
# - Lines starting with "#" (comment lines) in the configuration files
#   are ignored.
# - "sys_config" takes priority over "default_config".
# - Arguments specified on the command-line will override those
#   specified in a config file.
