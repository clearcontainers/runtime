# ciao-launcher

ciao-launcher is an SSNTP client that manages VM and container instances.  It runs on
compute and network nodes executing commands it receives from SSNTP servers,
primarily [scheduler](https://github.com/01org/ciao/blob/master/ciao-scheduler/README.md).  Its current feature set includes:

1. Launching and deleting of docker containers and qemu VMs on compute and network nodes
2. Basic monitoring of VMs and containers
3. Collection and transmission of compute node and instance (container or VM) statistics
4. Reconnection to existing VMs and containers on start up

We'll take a look at these features in more detail a little later on.  First,
let's see what is required to install and run launcher.

# Installation

## Getting the code

ciao-launcher can be downloaded and installed using go get

```go get github.com/01org/ciao/ciao-launcher```

The resulting binary will be placed in $GOPATH/bin, which you should already have
in your PATH.

## Installing Certificates

Certificates are assumed to be in /etc/pki/ciao, or can be
specified on the command line via the "-cert" and "-cacert"
command line options.  Certificates are created with the
[ciao-cert](https://github.com/01org/ciao/tree/master/ciao-cert)
tool.

ciao-launcher client certificates need to be generated with the agent or
the netagent roles or a combination of the two.

Correct generation of a cluster's certificates using the ciao-cert tool is required,
because metadata embedded within the certificates indicates where is the server
to which a launcher instance shall connect.

## Install Dependencies

ciao-launcher has dependencies on five external packages:

1. qemu-system-x86_64 and qemu-img, to launch the VMs and create qcow images
2. xorriso, to create ISO images for cloudinit
3. ovmf, EFI firmware required for some images
4. fuser, part of most distro's psmisc package
5. docker, to manage docker containers
6. ceph-common

All of these packages need to be installed on your compute node before launcher
can be run.

An optimized OVMF is available from ClearLinux.  Download the OVMF.fd
[file](https://download.clearlinux.org/image/OVMF.fd) and save it to
/usr/share/qemu/OVMF.fd on each node that will run launcher.

To create a new VM instance you need have a running ceph cluster.  The rootfs image
of the volume you wish to boot needs to be hosted in the cluster.  For testing
purposes the (ceph-demo)[https://hub.docker.com/r/ceph/demo/] docker container can be
used.

The images should have cloudinit installed and configured to use the ConfigDrive data source.
Currently, this is the only data source supported by launcher.

## Launching ciao-launcher

ciao-launcher can be launched from the command line as follows
```
sudo ciao-launcher
```

Currently, launcher needs to be run as root so that it can create network links and
launcher docker containers.

As previously mentioned the -cacert and -cert options can be used to override the SSNTP
certificates.

ciao-launcher uses glog for logging.  By default launcher stores logs in files written to
/var/lib/ciao/logs.  This behaviour can be overridden using a number of different
command line arguments added by glog, e.g., -alsologtostderr.

Here is a full list of the command line parameters supported by launcher.

```
Usage of ciao-launcher:
  -alsologtostderr
        log to standard error as well as files
  -cacert string
        Client certificate
  -ceph_id string
        ceph client id
  -cert string
        CA certificate
  -cpuprofile string
        write profile information to file
  -hard-reset
        Kill and delete all instances, reset networking and exit
  -log_backtrace_at value
        when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
  -log_dir string
        If non-empty, write log files in this directory
  -logtostderr
        log to standard error instead of files
  -network
        Enable networking (default true)
  -qemu-virtualisation value
        QEMU virtualisation method. Can be 'kvm', 'auto' or 'software' (default kvm)
  -simulation
        Launcher simulation
  -stderrthreshold value
        logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
  -trace string
        write trace information to file
  -v value
        log level for V logs
  -vmodule value
        comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
  -with-ui value
        Enables virtual consoles on VM instances.  Can be 'none', 'spice', 'nc' (default nc)
```

The --with-ui, --qemu-virtualisation and --cpuprofile options are disabled by
default.  To enable them use the debug and profile tags,  respectively.

# Commands
## START

START is used to create and launch a new VM instance.  Some example payloads
are discussed below:

The [first payload](https://github.com/01org/ciao/blob/master/ciao-launcher/tests/examples/start_legacy.yaml) creates a new CN VM instance using a ceph volume with the id
b286cd45-7d0c-4525-a140-4db6c95e41fa.  The disk image has a maximum size
of 80GBs and the VM will be run with two CPUS and 370MBs of memory.  The first
part of the payload corresponds to the cloudinit user-data file.  This data
will be extracted from the payload stored in an ISO image and passed to the
VM instance.  Assuming cloudinit is correctly configured on the backing image,
the file /etc/bootdone will be created and the hostname of the image will be
set to the instance uuid.

The [second payload](https://github.com/01org/ciao/blob/master/ciao-launcher/tests/examples/start_efi.yaml) creates a CN VM instance using a different image that
needs to be booted with EFI.

The [third payload](https://github.com/01org/ciao/blob/master/ciao-launcher/tests/examples/start_nn.yaml)
is an example of starting a VM instance on a NN.  Note that the networking parameters are different.

ciao-launcher detects and returns a number of errors when executing the start command.
These are listed below:

- invalid\_payload: if the YAML is corrupt

- invalid\_data: if the start section of the payload is corrupt or missing
information such as image-id

- already\_running: if you try to start an existing instance that is already running

- instance\_exists: if you try to start an instance that has already been created
but is not currently running

- image\_failure: If launcher is unable to prepare the file for the instance, e.g., the
image_uuid refers to an non-existent backing image

- network_failure: It was not possible to initialise networking for the instance

- full_cn: The node has insufficient resources to start the requested instance

- launch\_failure: If the instance has been successfully created but could not be launched.


## DELETE

DELETE can be used to destroy an existing VM instance.  It removes all the
files associated with that instance from the compute node.  If the VM instance
is running when the DELETE command is received it will be powered down.

See [here](https://github.com/01org/ciao/blob/master/ciao-launcher/tests/examples/delete_legacy.yaml) for an example of the DELETE command.

# Recovery

When launcher starts up it checks to see if any VM instances exist and if they
do it tries to connect to them.  This means that you can easily kill launcher,
restart it and continue to use it to manage previously created VMs.


# Reporting

ciao-launcher sends STATS commands and STATUS updates to the SSNTP server to which
it is connected.  STATUS updates are sent when launcher connects to the SSNTP
server.  They are also sent when a VM instance is successfully created or
destroyed, informing the upper levels of the stack that the capacity of
launcher's compute node has changed.  The STATS command is sent when launcher
connects to the SSNTP server and every 30 seconds thereafter.

ciao-launcher computes the information that it sends back in the STATS command and
STATUS update payloads as follows:

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Datum</th><th>Source</th></tr>
<tr><td>MemTotalMB</td><td>/proc/meminfo:MemTotal</td></tr>
<tr><td>MemAvailableMB</td><td>/proc/meminfo:MemFree + Active(file) + Inactive(file)</td></tr>
<tr><td>DiskTotalMB</td><td>statfs("/var/lib/ciao/instances")</td></tr>
<tr><td>DiskAvailableMB</td><td>statfs("/var/lib/ciao/instances")</td></tr>
<tr><td>Load</td><td>/proc/loadavg (Average over last minute reported)</td></tr>
<tr><td>CpusOnLine</td><td>Number of cpu[0-9]+ entries in /proc/stat</td></tr>
</table>

And instance statistics are computed like this

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Datum</th><th>Source</th></tr>
<tr><td>SSHIP</td><td>IP of the concentrator node, see below</td></tr>
<tr><td>SSHPort</td><td>Port number on the concentrator node which can be used to ssh into the instance</td></tr>
<tr><td>MemUsageMB</td><td>pss of qemu of docker process id</td></tr>
<tr><td>DiskUsageMB</td><td>Size of rootfs</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPUUsage</td><td>Amount of cpuTime consumed by instance over 30 second period, normalized for number of VCPUs</td></tr>
</table>

ciao-launcher sends two different STATUS updates, READY and FULL.  FULL is sent
when launcher determines that there is insufficient memory or disk space available
on the node on which it runs to launch another instance.  It also returns FULL
if it determines that the launcher process is running low on file descriptors.
The memory and disk space checks can be disabled using the -mem-limit and
-disk-limit command line options.  The file descriptor limit check cannot be
disabled.

# Testing ciao-launcher in Isolation

ciao-launcher is part of the ciao network statck and is usually run and tested
in conjunction with the other ciao components.  However, it is often
useful in debugging and development to test ciao-launcher in isolation of the
other ciao components.  This can be done using two tools in the
tests directory.

The first tool, ciao-launcher-server, is an simple SSNTP server.  It can be
used to send commands to and receive events from multiple launchers.  
ciao-launcher-server exposes a REST API.  Commands can be sent to it
directly using curl, if you know the URLs, or directly with the tool, ciaolc.
We'll look at some examples of using ciaolc below.

To get started copy the test certs in https://github.com/01org/ciao/tree/master/ciao-launcher/tests/ciao-launcher-server to /etc/pki/ciao.  Then run
ciao-launcher-server.

Open a new terminal and start ciao-launcher, e.g.,

./ciao-launcher --logtostderr -cert tests/ciao-launcher-server/cert-client-localhost.pem  --cacert tests/ciao-launcher-server/CAcert-server-localhost.pem

Open a new terminal and try some ciaolc commands

To retrieve a list of instances type

```
$ ciaolc instances
d7d86208-b46c-4465-9018-fe14087d415f
67d86208-b46c-4465-9018-e14287d415f
```

To retrieve detailed information about the instances

```
$ cialoc istats
UUID					Status	SSH			Mem	Disk	CPU
d7d86208-b46c-4465-9018-fe14087d415f	running	192.168.42.21:35050	492 MB	339 MB	0%
67d86208-b46c-4465-9018-e14287d415f	running	192.168.200.200:61519	14 MB	189 MB	0%
```

Both of the above commands take a filter parameter.  So to see only the pending
instances type

```
$ ciaolc instances --filter pending
```

A new instance can be started using the startf command.  You need to provide
a file containing a valid start payload.  There are some examples 
[here](https://github.com/01org/ciao/tree/master/ciao-launcher/tests/examples)

```
$ ciaolc startf start_legacy.yaml
```

Please note that when starting VM instances you need to have a pre-created rbd
image containing the rootfs of the VM.  Instructions for creating the image are
provided in the storage section below.

Instances can be deleted using the delete command.  Delete requires an instance-uuid,
e.g.,

```
$ ciaolc delete d7d86208-b46c-4465-9018-fe14087d415f
```

The most recent stats returned by the launcher can be retrieved using the
stats command, e.g,

```
$ ciaolc stats
NodeUUID:	 dacf409a-7c7e-48c7-b382-546168ab6cdf
Status:		 READY
MemTotal:	 7856 MB
MemAvailable:	 5220 MB
DiskTotal:	 231782 MB
DiskAvailable:	 166163 MB
Load:		 0
CpusOnline:	 4
NodeHostName:	 
Instances:	 2 (2 running 0 exited 0 pending)
```

You can retrieve a list of events and errors received for a
ciao-launcher instance using the drain command:

```
$ ciaolc drain
- instance_deleted:
    instance_uuid: d7d86208-b46c-4465-9018-fe14087d415f
```

Once drained, the events are deleted from inside the ciao-launcher-server.
Running subsequent drain commands will return nothing, assuming that no
new events have been generated.

Finally, you can connect multiple ciao-launchers to the ciao-server-launcher
instance.  If you do this you need to specify which launcher you would like
to command when issuing a command via ciaolc.  This can be done via the 
--client option.

e.g.,

```
$ ciaolc drain --client dacf409a-7c7e-48c7-b382-546168ab6cdf
- instance_deleted:
    instance_uuid: d7d86208-b46c-4465-9018-fe14087d415f
```

A list of connected clients can be obtained with the clients command.

# Connecting to QEMU Instances

There are two options.  The preferred option is to create a user and associate
an ssh key with that user in the cloud-init payload that gets sent with the
START comnmand that creates the VM.  You can see an example of such a payload
here:

https://github.com/01org/ciao/blob/master/ciao-launcher/tests/examples/start_efi.yaml

Once the start command has succeeded and the instance has been launched you can
connect to it via SSH using the IP address of the concentrator.  You also need to
specify a port number, which can be computed using the following formula:

33000 + ip[2] << 8 + ip[3]

where ip is the ip address of the instance as specified in the START command.
For example, if the IP address of the instance is 192.168.0.2, the ssh port
would be 33002.  Launcher actually sends the SSH IP address and port number
of each instance in the stats commands.  This information should normally be
shown in the ciao UI.

Please note that ssh is typically only used when you are running a complete
ciao stack, including ciao-scheduler, ciao-controller and a network node.
Howevever, it should be possible to get it to work by manually starting
a concentrator instance on a network node before you launch your instance.

The second method is to compile launcher with the debug tag, e.g.,
go build --tags debug.  This will add a new command line option that can
be used to connect to an instance via netcat or spice.  To use this method you
need to look in the launcher logs when launching an instance.  You should see
some instructions in the logs telling you how to connect to the instance.
Here's an example,

```
I0407 14:38:10.874786    8154 qemu.go:375] ============================================
I0407 14:38:10.874830    8154 qemu.go:376] Connect to vm with netcat 127.0.0.1 5909
I0407 14:38:10.874849    8154 qemu.go:377] ============================================
```

netcat 127.0.0.1 5909 will give you a login prompt.  You might need to press return to see the login.   Note this will only work if the VM allows login on the
console port, i.e., is running getty on ttyS0.

# Connecting to Docker Container Instances

This can only be done from the compute note that is running the docker
container.

1. Install nsenter
2. sudo docker ps -a | grep <instance-uuid>
3. copy the container-id
4. PID=$(sudo docker inspect -f {{.State.Pid}} <container-id>)
5. sudo nsenter --target $PID --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid

See [here](https://blog.docker.com/tag/nsenter/) for more information.

# Storage

Ciao-launcher allows you to attach ceph volumes to both containers and VMs.
Volumes can be attached to an instance on creation and attached and detached at
runtime (VMs only).  Ciao-launcher make some assumptions about storage.  These
assumptions are documented in the sections that follow.

## Attaching a volume to a VM at creation time

The workload for the instance needs to contain a Storage section, e.g,

```
...
start:
  requested_resources:
  ...
  instance_uuid: d7d86208-b46c-4465-9018-fe14087d415f
  ...
  storage:
    - id: 67d86208-000-4465-9018-fe14087d415f

```

For a full example see
[here](https://github.com/01org/ciao/blob/master/ciao-launcher/tests/examples/start_legacy_volume.yaml).

The id is the image-name of the RBD image to be mounted.  It does not include the
pool name, which is assumed to be RBD for now.  The id must be a valid UUID.  The
RBD image does not need to be formatted or to contain a file system.  It will appear
as a block device in the booted VM.  The first volume will be /dev/vdc, the second
/dev/vdd, and so on.

## Booting a VM from a RBD image

You first need to populate an image with a rootfs. An example of how to do this
with Ubuntu Server 16.04 is given below.

```
sudo qemu-img convert -O rbd ~/Downloads/ubuntu-16.04.1-server-amd64.iso rbd:rbd/73a86d7e-93c0-480e-9c41-ab42f69b7799
```

The ubuntu-16.04.1-server-amd64.iso is assumed to be present in your ~/Downloads folder.

In this case your workload would look something like this:

```
...
start:
  requested_resources:
  ...
  instance_uuid: d7d86208-b46c-4465-9018-fe14087d415f
  ...
  storage:
    - id: 67d86208-000-4465-9018-fe14087d415f
      boot: true
```

For a full example see
[here](https://github.com/01org/ciao/blob/master/ciao-launcher/tests/examples/start_legacy_volume_boot.yaml).

# Attaching and Detaching RBD images

Volumes can be attach and detached from VM instances after those instance have
been created.  This can be done regardless of whether the instance is actually
running or not.  It is possible to detach an instance that was attached in the
original workload that created the instance, e.g., via the storage field in
the YAML payload.  It is not possible to attach or detach RBD images from
containers.

## Attaching a volume to a container at creation time

The only way to attach an RBD image to a container is at creation time. This
is done in the same way as attaching an RBD image to VM instance, namely
by specifying the volume UUID under the storage field in the START payload.
The main difference between attaching an RBD image to a VM and a container
is that the image attached to a container needs to be formatted with a file
system that is auto detectable by mount.  Currently, RBD images are mounted
under /volumes/<UUID>, where <UUID> is the UUID of the image.  They are also
mounted RW.
