Description: Ciao - Cloud Integrated Advanced Orchestrator
 .
 Ciao is the "Cloud Integrated Advanced Orchestrator".  Its goal is
 to provide an easy to deploy, secure, scalable cloud orchestration
 system which handles virtual machines, containers, and bare metal apps
 agnostically as generic workloads.  Implemented in the Go language, it
 separates logic into "controller", "scheduler" and "launcher" components
 which communicate over the "Simple and Secure Node Transfer Protocol
 (SSNTP)".
