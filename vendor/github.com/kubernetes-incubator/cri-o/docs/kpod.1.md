# NAME
kpod

# SYNOPSIS
**kpod**
[**--help**|**-h**]

# DESCRIPTION
kpod is a simple client only tool to help with debugging issues when daemons
such as CRI runtime and the kubelet are not responding or failing. A shared API
layer could be created to share code between the daemon and kpod. kpod does not
require any daemon running. kpod utilizes the same underlying components that
crio uses i.e. containers/image, container/storage, oci-runtime-tool/generate,
runc or any other OCI compatible runtime. kpod shares state with crio and so
has the capability to debug pods/images created by crio.
